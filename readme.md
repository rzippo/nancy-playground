# Nancy-Playground

This project is meant to replicate RTaW's _Network calculus interpreter_ interface and features so that

 - Pleople used to that interface can easily migrate to Nancy
 - Code shared in that form can be run and studied locally, using Nancy

# Syntax name and file extension

The names for the tool and its syntax change often in publicly available docs and examples.
This is a problem since I will need to refer to the syntax many times.
Therefore, I hereby declare _MPPG_ as the name of the syntax and `.mppg` as the corresponding file extension.
The acronym stands for _Min-Plus PlayGround_.

> I am not aware of a better or more fitting idea, let me know if you do.

See the [MPPG Syntax](/syntax.md) docs for a summary of the supported constructs.

The file extension can be used to associate it with the programs created in this project.
