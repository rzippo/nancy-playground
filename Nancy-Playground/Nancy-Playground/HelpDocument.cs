f and g can be variable names or expressions, and can evaluate to either functions or scalars.
For two functions, the relation must hold for all t: f(t) OP g(t).
For function vs scalar c, the relation must hold for all t: f(t) OP c.
Supported operators are =, !=, <=, and >=.

If the assertion holds, prints `true`, otherwise `false`.
